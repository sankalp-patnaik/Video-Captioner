# Video Captioner Web App

Welcome to the Video Captioner Web App! This web application allows users to add captions to a video along with timestamps. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for captioning videos and playing them with captions.

## Setup Instructions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Open the project directory in your file explorer.

### Running the App

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the app.

## Usage

1. Enter the URL of the video in the provided input field.
2. Enter the caption text and timestamp (in the format HH:MM:SS) for the caption.
3. Click the "Add Caption" button to add the caption to the video.
4. Use the play and pause buttons to control the video playback.
5. The captions will be displayed at the specified timestamps during video playback.

## Technical Decisions

- **Frontend**: The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
- **Styling**: CSS is used for styling with a modern and clean look to enhance user experience.
- **Functionality**: JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, manage video playback, and display captions.

## Trade-offs

- **Simplicity vs. Features**: The focus was on simplicity and ease of use. Some advanced features, such as editing captions or more complex timestamp formats, were not implemented to keep the app straightforward.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, here are some improvements that could be made to enhance the user experience:

- Implementing features for editing and deleting captions.
- Supporting more video formats and sources.
- Enhancing the UI with additional styling and animations.
- Adding authentication and user accounts for saving and sharing captioned videos.
